# Processing of sequencing data of DOP-PCR libraries from isolated chromosomes
# Configuration parameters for processing of one sample are given step by step. Some parameters not listed here are embedded in scripts.
# Usage: dopseq_pipe.py dopseq_pipe.config
# Output files are written to current folder. For details see comments below.
# Expects all executables in ../exec/ relative to b_dopseq_pipe.py

# Assignable parameters

sample=ACAG # sample name - used as prefix for all files
fastq_F_file=../examples/test.F.fastq # path to file with forward reads
fastq_R_file=../examples/test.R.fastq # path to file with reverse reads

target_genome=../../data/genome/anoCar2/anoCar2 # path and prefix for bowtie2 index of target genome
contam_genome=../../data/genome/hg19/hg19 # path and prefix for bowtie2 index of contamination genome (human in our case)
sizes_file=../../data/genome/anoCar2/anoCar2.sizes # tab-separated file with chromosomes and their sizes (can be obtained from UCSC database). Note that only chromosomes listed in this file are processed.

wga=false # trim off DOP (default) or WGA primers (for MiDi library), change to true if WGA primers should be trimmed off
proc_bowtie2=1 # number of processors allocated for bowtie2

# Step 1. fastq_to_bam.py - Aligns pair of fastq read files to target and contamination genomes with preliminary DOP primer and Illumina adapter removal.
# Output files: sample.F.ca.fastq (intermediate), sample.R.ca.fastq (intermediate), sample.target_genome.sam, sample.contam_genome.sam (both removed in Step 2).

# Step 2. contam_filter.py - Removes contamination reads by comparing MAPQs to target and cotamination genomes. Outputs sorted and indexed bams.
# Requires pysam
# Output files: sample.target_genome.filter.bam, sample.target_genome.unmap.bam, sample.contam_genome.contam.bam + .bai indices

# Step 3. bam_to_beds.py - From filtered bam file creates reads and positions bed files.
# Output files: sample.target_genome.filter.reads.bed, sample.target_genome.filter.pos.bed

# Step 4. regions_dnacopy.R - From positions bed file generates bed-like file with regions and their statistics and pdf plot for all chromosomes listed in .sizes file. 
# Requires R::DNAcopy (installation commands available in script)
# Output files: sample.target_genome.filter.reg.tsv

# After one can mannually add homologies and homology scores to tsv file using adding_hom.py script
# And inspect results in any software working with tables (e.g. Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc)
